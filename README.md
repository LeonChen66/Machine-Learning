### Course Description 
###### Machine learning is the study of self-modifying computer systems that can acquire new knowledge and improve their own performance; survey machine learning techniques, which include induction from examples, conceptual clustering, explanation-based learning, exemplar learning and analogy, discovery and genetic algorithms.Â 

###### Machine learning is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn and/or act without being explicitly programmed. Applications of machine learning have permeated many aspects of every-day life and can be found among others in self-driving cars, speech recognition, computer vision, and genomics. Topics include supervised and unsupervised learning (including parametric and non-parametric models, clustering, dimensionality reduction, deep learning), optimization procedures, and statistical inference.
